The Unreal library (UELib) provides you an API to read (parse/deserialize) the contents of Unreal Engine game package files such as .UDK, .UPK.
Its main purpose is to decompile the UnrealScript byte-code to its original source-code.

It accomplishes this by reading the necessary Unreal data classes such as:

    UObject, UField, UConst, UEnum, UProperty, UStruct, UFunction, UState,
    UClass, UTextBuffer, UMetaData, UFont, USound, UPackage

Classes such as UStruct, UState, UClass, and UFunction contain the UnrealScript byte-code which we can deserialize in order to re-construct the byte-codes to its original UnrealScript source.

## How to use

To use this library you will need [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) (The library will move to .NET 6 or higher at version 2.0)

Install using either:

* Package Manager:

``` cmd
Install-Package Eliot.UELib.dll
```

* NuGet: <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Eliot.UELib.dll>

See [usage](https://github.com/EliotVU/Unreal-Library/wiki/Usage) for further instructions on how to use the library in your project.

If you're looking to modify the library for the sole purpose of modding [UE Explorer](https://eliotvu.com/portfolio/view/21/ue-explorer), I recommend you to clone or fork this repository and install UE Explorer within your ```UELib/src/bin/Debug/``` folder, or change the project's configuration to build inside of the UE Explorer's folder.

Want to try out the [latest library release](https://github.com/EliotVU/Unreal-Library/releases)? Then you can simply save ```Eliot.UELib.dll``` to the folder where you have installed UE Explorer at. Note that the current release of UE Explorer is using version [1.2.7.1](https://github.com/EliotVU/Unreal-Library/releases/tag/release-1.2.7.1).

**Beware, opening an unsupported package could crash your system! Make sure you have
saved everything before opening any file!**

**Note** UE3 production-ready packages are often **compressed** and must first be decompressed, [Unreal Package Decompressor](https://www.gildor.org/downloads) by **Gildor** is a tool that can decompress most packages for you; for some games you need a specialized decompressor, see for example [RLUPKTool](https://github.com/AltimorTASDK/RLUPKTool).
